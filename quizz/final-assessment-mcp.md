# Final Assessment on MCP

## Question 1

You're building an MCP client to connect your application to an MCP server. What are the two main components you need?

- [ ] A frontend and a backend
- [ ] A database and a web server
- [ ] A REST API and a GraphQL endpoint
- [x] An MCP Client class and a Client Session

## Question 2

Your MCP client needs to find out what tools are available from an MCP server. What message type should it send?

- [x] ListToolsRequest
- [ ] CallToolRequest
- [ ] ToolDiscoveryRequest
- [ ] GetToolsMessage

## Question 3

You've built an MCP server and want to test if your tools work correctly before connecting to a full application. What's the easiest way to do this?

- [ ] Write separate test scripts for each tool
- [ ] Test everything manually in the terminal
- [x] Use the built-in MCP Inspector with `mcp dev mcp_server.py`
- [ ] Connect directly to Claude first

## Question 4

You're building a chat app where users ask Claude about their GitHub data. Without MCP, what's the main problem you'd face?

- [ ] GitHub doesn't allow API access
- [x] You'd have to write and maintain all the GitHub tool code yourself
- [ ] Claude can't understand GitHub data
- [ ] Users can't ask questions about repositories

## Question 5

You're deciding how to implement a new feature in your MCP server. Users should be able to click a button to trigger a "summarize document" workflow. Which MCP primitive should you use?

- [ ] Resources - because you need to fetch document data
- [ ] Functions - because it involves processing
- [x] Prompts - because users control when to start the workflow
- [ ] Tools - because the AI needs new capabilities

## Question 6

You're using the Python MCP SDK to create a tool that reads files. What's the easiest way to define this tool?

- [x] Use the @mcp.tool() decorator on a Python function
- [ ] Create a separate configuration file
- [ ] Write JSON schemas manually
- [ ] Send HTTP requests to register the tool

## Question 7

You want to create a resource that fetches different documents based on their ID, like docs://documents/report.pdf. What type of resource should you use?

- [x] A templated resource with parameters in the URI
- [ ] A tool instead of a resource
- [ ] A direct resource with a static URI
- [ ] A database query resource
